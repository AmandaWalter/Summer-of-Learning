#Welcome to OC Tanner and the Summer of Learning

We are very excited to begin learning with you. Over the next 12 weeks you will be learning how to think like a developer, how to write programs in both Java and Angular.js, and how developers work *in the wild*. 

The Summer of Learning is open to anyone who wants to learn with us. We will host weekly meetings to give participants a place to discuss what they learned during the week, as well as introduce some topics not covered in the self-paced courses. We will periodically have project days so that we use our new knowledge creatively and work together. Those who will be interns in the Fall (or are on the alternates list) are strongly encouraged to come to the weekly meetings, but they are not required.

We hope that you find this collection of resources helpful and entertaining. If you have any questions or feedback for us, please share with us as soon as you can. This will allow us to help you while it is relevant, and if an issue may affect others, we can get information to them quickly.

Once again, welcome! We hope you are as excited to get started as we are!

#Calendar for Summer study groups
####Discussion/ speaker days will allow time for questions to be answered/ pair work with mentors as well as a group discussion about a cool topic.

#Knowledge Expectations
When we begin the internship in the Fall, our goal is to have everyone on the same base level. This will aid in pairing, so that when you pair, the mentor will know where your knowledge is and can set goals and expectations from there.

If you follow this guide and the provided calendar, you will have met the expectations we have for interns entering this Fall. 

If you begin to feel like you are behind, or having to leave things 'half-finished' to keep up with the calendar, reach out to a mentor or the intern lead early and often! Treat your learning the way you would an Agile project. Keeping conversations and evaluation short and frequent can save much headache and wasted time!

#Intro to Software Design & Process
##Learning Outcomes:

The Design Process

- Describe the design process
- How does the designer involove the client/user in the design process?
* What are some ways of communicating with a user to understand their needs & goals?
* What is friction, as it applies to design?
* What tools exist to help the designer reduce friction?

* How can you use typography to influence a visitor's actions in a web page? 

On Mockups

* What is a mockup? How are they used in design?
* Think about the tradeoff between time spent planning design vs. designing as you go. Consider the clien't reactions to these methods as well.
* Use mockups to plan different kinds of web sites. (commerce, personal, large company, small business, tools/ apps)

On the Principles of Software Engineering

* How do software engineers approach a problem? How do you think about problems? Did this section influence your approach to problem solving?
* Is software engineering only concerned with writing code (a product)? Why would process be so important?

* How does Agile development address these problems?
* Describe XP and some techniques employed by this method
* What is SCRUM?
* How do we get a user story from a product?
* Describe what a user story contains? What should a user story not contain?

On Pseudocoding and Good Software Design

* Why do we use pseudocode?
* What is modularity?
* Pseudocode a common task, like doing laundry.
* How does a modular approach to software design help improve design? 
* What are the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented software design?


#Introductory Computer Science##Learning Outcomes:- Summarize the history of computing- Can you say a few sentences that describe fundamental hardware and software concepts- Explain how the JVM translates Java code into executable code- Explain Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance and polymorphism- Write simple programs using basic Java concepts- Describe and use primitive data types in Java- Describe and use logical and relational operators and compare Boolean expressions- Explain and use various control structures such as methods, decision statements, and loops- Use exception handling mechanism- Use Java input/output class hierarchy to read and write data to and from external files.

##III. JS, jQuery & Angular

**Time estimate to complete: 15 days @ 3-4 hours/day**

We will be using Angular in the fall, so our final section will cover what you will need to be comfortable with by the time the internship starts. You will have some options on which program you learn from, choose the one that appeals to you! 

If you are unfamiliar with Code School ad codecademy, Code School offerst short video with follow-along examples and short assessments. The videos are themed and usually interesting! 

Codecademy is more reading as you do instruction, the advantage being that introductory material is written for your leisure, instead of video form. 

Pluralsight offers really high quality learning content. We will make sure everyone has a 1-free-month supscription pass to use on the courses. As long as you don't activate the code before we start the 3rd module, you will not have to pay anything for Pluralsight access.
